## Defensive Programming

Forms:
- Users cannot submit an empty form
- Users must fill in all required form fields

Django:
- Users cannot brute-force a URL to navigate to a restricted page
- Users cannot perform CRUD functionality while logged-out
- User-A should not be able to manipulate data belonging to User-B, or vice versa
- Non-Authenticated users should not be able to access pages that require authentication
- Standard users should not be able to access pages intended for superusers

Defensive programming was manually tested with the below user acceptance testing:

## Bugs

**Fixed Bugs**

- Missing Alt Attributes
  When running my HTML Templates through the HTML Validator I received an Error for missing img alt attributes. I fixed this by adding alt attributes to the placeholder image and the recipe image uploaded by users when posting a new recipe. 

- Like Functionality not working
  When clicking the heart on a recipe as a logged in user, the like would not show up. I realised that in my RecipeLikes View in views.py I had named my function "recipe" instead of "post" which meant the action wasn't being understood as a post method. 

    ```python
    class RecipeLikes(View):
        """
            Class based function to like a recipe
    """
        def post(self, request, slug, *args, **kwargs):
            recipe = get_object_or_404(Recipe, slug=slug)
            if recipe.likes.filter(id=request.user.id).exists():
                recipe.likes.remove(request.user)
                messages.success(
                    request,
                    'Recipe successfully unliked.'
                )
            else:
                recipe.likes.add(request.user)
                messages.success(
                    request,
                    'Recipe successfully liked.'
                )
            return HttpResponseRedirect(reverse('recipe_detail', args=[slug]))
```

**Unfixed Bugs**

There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of.
